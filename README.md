# Learning all things Node.

## Introduction
For my minor of Web Design and Development, we have to take notes and reflect on the presentations from weekly guest speakers and report this in a blog. As I was coming up with my concept for this blog, I realised quickly, and especially when I looked up to my peers, that I needed to learn more to up my game and to achieve what I wanted. This is me challenging myself, and I'm aspiring to learn Node.js, Express.js and EJS. I'll be documenting this here. 

T.B.A: Index, Usage and features, Wiki, and of course the code.
